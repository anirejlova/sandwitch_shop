## Sandwich Shop (sandwitch_shop)

A simple Flutter app for counting and configuring sandwich orders.

This project demonstrates a minimal ordering UI where a user can:

- Choose sandwich size (six-inch or footlong)
- Select a bread type (white, wheat, wholemeal)
- Add a short order note (e.g., "no onions")
- Increment / decrement the sandwich quantity (limited by a configurable maximum)

The app is intentionally small and focused, making it easy to extend as a learning or demo project.

## Key features

- Quantity counter with Add / Remove buttons (max quantity is configurable; the shipped app sets it to 5)
- Size toggle (six-inch ↔ footlong)
- Bread type dropdown
- Notes text field
- Simple, reusable repository-style class (`OrderRepository`) to manage quantity and limits

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK compatible with this project (see `pubspec.yaml`): Dart SDK constraint is >=2.17.0 <4.0.0. Using a recent stable Flutter release is recommended.
- Platform-specific tooling if you plan to run on mobile/desktop:
	- Android: Android Studio + Android SDK and an emulator or device
	- iOS/macOS: Xcode (macOS only)
	- Windows: Visual Studio (for desktop builds) and PowerShell (the default shell)

For general Flutter install instructions and platform setup, follow the official guide: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

## Quick start (Windows / PowerShell)

Open a PowerShell terminal at the project root (where `pubspec.yaml` is located) and run:

```powershell
# Fetch dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the app (choose a device/emulator). Examples:
# Run on the default connected device or emulator
flutter run

# Run on Windows desktop
flutter run -d windows

# Run on Chrome (web)
flutter run -d chrome
```

To build release artifacts:

```powershell
# Android APK
flutter build apk

# Windows release
flutter build windows
```

To run tests (this project includes the `flutter_test` dev dependency):

```powershell
flutter test
```

## Usage / App behavior

When you open the app you will see the sandwich counter screen with:

- A line showing the current quantity, bread type, sandwich size, and a fun sandwich emoji display.
- A size toggle (six-inch / footlong). The code maps a boolean to these two sizes.
- A dropdown to pick the `BreadType` (white, wheat, wholemeal).
- A notes text field (key: `notes_textfield`) — the text appears under the order summary.
- "Add" and "Remove" buttons to change the quantity. Buttons are disabled when the quantity reaches the floor (0) or the configured ceiling (maxQuantity).

Implementation notes:
- The screen component is `OrderScreen` in `lib/main.dart`. The app currently constructs `OrderScreen(maxQuantity: 5)` (so the counter stops at 5).
- Quantity logic is encapsulated in `lib/repositories/order_repository.dart`.
- Styles are in `lib/views/app_styles.dart`.

## Project structure

Top-level (important items):

- `lib/main.dart` — main entrypoint, UI for ordering (OrderScreen, OrderItemDisplay, StyledButton)
- `lib/repositories/order_repository.dart` — encapsulates quantity, increment/decrement, and limits
- `lib/views/app_styles.dart` — shared text styles used by the UI
- `pubspec.yaml` — Dart/Flutter SDK constraints and package dependencies
- Platform folders: `android/`, `ios/`, `windows/`, `macos/`, `linux/`, `web/` — platform-specific project files generated by Flutter

You can explore other folders for platform build settings and generated assets.

## Technologies used

- Flutter (UI toolkit)
- Dart (language)
- cupertino_icons (icons package)
- flutter_lints (dev lint rules)

## Extending the app (ideas)

- Persist orders locally (e.g., shared_preferences or SQLite)
- Add a list/cart screen that collects multiple order items
- Connect to a backend to place orders
- Improve accessibility, localization, and input validation
